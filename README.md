# DGLoad

Thank you for purchasing DGLoad! Here's some information you might find useful to get the most out of your purchase.

## Installing

For an installation guide, check the documentation: http://dangeo.pw/dgload/docs.html#installation

## Configuration

There's a lot to configuration, and it couldn't fit in this README. The code is well-commented, so you can dig through that 
if you *really* want to. But, assuming you don't, you can use the editor at http://dangeo.pw/dgload/editor.html or visit the documentation at http://dangeo.pw/dgload/docs.

If you need help with something that isn't covered by the documentation, you can open up a ScriptFodder support ticket
or you can send an email to contact@dangeo.pw.
